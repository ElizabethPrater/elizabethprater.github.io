Reflection Paper

At the beginning of this class, when asked to pick a topic for a project, I was intimidated and nervous. I don’t necessarily like having too many options. I wound up picking a Windows console application for my project because I have the most experience in those currently and the other options seemed a bit too out of reach for me right now, partially because lack of access to the proper software for developing them. Choosing what kind of application I would do was a little more difficult to determine. I definitely wanted it to be a game, since games are a big part of my life. When I chose Hangman for my project, It seemed like it had the most room for creative freedom while also not being too advanced. 
During the initial design phase, I had to do a lot of brainstorming and refreshing my memory on the relationships between the functions of the application. I feel like this was the easiest and quickest part of the project. With the design of the application diagram, I had to research a lot more on how exactly to put that together.
	During the second week, while building the base blocks of the application, the beginning part of the code, using system block, kept giving me errors because I had forgot to make a class for the application, which took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize. 
	Week 3 was pretty enjoyable because that’s when I added a lot of the phrases for the game and added in the randomized feature for the responses to the user input.
	In week 4, I was trying to work on clearing up and fixing the syntax errors caused by incorrect form in the part where the Hangman figure is supposed to be built.
	This last week has been pretty stressful in the sense that I’m not sure if the final result of my project is good enough. I know many improvements can be made in the future, yet I honestly feel like I could’ve done better with the current resources that I have access to.
Using what I have listed in my final project paper under future improvements, I will be continuing the development and design of the application that I made. I think I could turn it into something great with enough practice. Overall, this project was enjoyable and helpful in not only refreshing the previous knowledge on the subject, but also learning a few new things, like how to randomize things in an application.
